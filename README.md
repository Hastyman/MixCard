# MixCard
Three channel synth mixer in convenient business card sized format.
Card was created as part of a series from creators participating in the
www.synthcard.com project.

This is my take on a Synth DIY mixer --
It's a mix circuit based 
on the NPN Transistor. Credit and thanks for
the original schematic goes to NJ Ramsden.
